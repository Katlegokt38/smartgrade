## Description
This repository represents a remote collaboration for SmartGrade offered by the University of Pretoria. SmartGrade is a web application that will simplify the grading process for lecturers and teachers. This system automates the mark allocation process and by having such a system in place, it can also identify students that are struggling and provide predictive analysis to see what forms of assessment students are doing better in. This helps in adjusting learning outcomes to target areas where students struggle.
